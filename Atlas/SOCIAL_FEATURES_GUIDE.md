# üèÜ Social Features & Gamification System

I've built a comprehensive friend system and gamification platform for your workout tracker! Here's what's now available:

### 2. **TypeScript Types** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
Complete type definitions for all social features:
- `UserProfile`, `Friendship`, `Challenge`, `Achievement`
- `WorkoutPost`, `LeaderboardEntry`, `ActivityFeedItem`
- Full type safety across the entire social system

## üöÄ Next Steps to Implement

-- and run it in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. **Set Up User Profiles**
When users sign up, create their profile:
```typescript
await SocialApi.createUserProfile(userId, username, displayName);
```

### 3. **Integrate Achievement Tracking**
Add achievement checks after workouts:
```typescript
// After completing a workout
await checkAndAwardAchievements(userId, sessionData);
```

### 4. **Enable Social Sharing**
Add "Share Workout" buttons after sessions:
```typescript
await SocialApi.createWorkoutPost(userId, sessionId, caption, 'friends');
```

### 5. **Challenge Integration**
Connect challenge progress to actual workout data:
- Volume challenges track session volume automatically
- Workout count challenges increment on session completion
- Streak challenges check daily workout completion

## üé® UI Features

## üîß Customization Options

### **Challenge Creation**
Easily create custom challenges:
```typescript
const challenge = await SocialApi.createChallenge({
  title: "30-Day Push-up Challenge",
  type: "exercise_specific",
  exercise_id: pushupExerciseId,
  target_value: 1000,
  start_date: "2024-01-01",
  end_date: "2024-01-31",
  is_public: true
});
```

### **Custom Achievements**
Add new achievements with JSON criteria:
```sql
INSERT INTO achievements (name, description, criteria, xp_reward, rarity) VALUES 
('Squat Master', 'Squat 2x your bodyweight', 
 '{"type": "exercise_pr", "exercise": "Squat", "multiplier": 2}', 
 400, 'epic');
```

This system transforms your workout tracker into a social fitness platform where users can compete, share achievements, and stay motivated through friendly competition! üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
